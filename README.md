kotlin pentominoe puzzle solver

found this puzzle on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4057018, printed it out, and after a bit of time trying to solve it, I tried to find a solution or a hint to help me solve it. Since I couldn't find any solutions, I decided to write a quick program to help find a solution so I could give myself a hint.

just doing a brute force search - trying every orientation of every piece at every coordinate on the board. finding solutions to standard pentominoe puzzles, but not finding a solution to the puzzle I printed or other puzzles by same creator.
